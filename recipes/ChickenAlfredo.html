      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>A recipe for chicken alfredo with fettuccine noodles</p>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 large boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 cups of freshly grated Parmigiano cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over
          medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low;
          simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5
          minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15
          minutes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving
          the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle,
          cut into bite-size slices.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1
          cup.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth;
          bring to a simmer and remove from heat.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm
          cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated; repeat
          until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the
          remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking
          constantly, until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens,
          about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the
          pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until
          thick.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to
          serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
